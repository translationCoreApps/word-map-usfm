# word-map-usfm
This library provides utilities for injecting alignment data from [wordMAP](https://github.com/translationCoreApps/word-map) into USFM3.



## Roadmap

* Support extracting alignment data from USFM3. This will be useful when importing usfm into [tC](https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/translationCore).
